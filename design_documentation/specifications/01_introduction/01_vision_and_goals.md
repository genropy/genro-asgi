# Introduction and Vision

Genro-ASGI is designed to be a solid, modern, and asynchronous foundation for the Genro ecosystem, while remaining agnostic to heavy application logic.

## Project Goals

1.  **ASGI Foundation**: Provide a standard interface for asynchronous communication.
2.  **Modularity**: Allow fluid mounting and unmounting of applications (microservices).
3.  **Native Integration**: Leverage core Genro libraries (`genro-routes`, `genro-toolbox`, `genro-tytx`).
4.  **Modern SPA Support**: Manage complex Single Page Applications with persistent sessions and real-time communication.
