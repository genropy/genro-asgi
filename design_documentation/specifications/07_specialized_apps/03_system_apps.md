# System Applications: Swagger and GenroApi

Genro-ASGI includes built-in applications to improve the developer experience by exposing the server's internal structure.

## SwaggerApp
Automatically generates an interactive API documentation interface based on the `OpenAPI` schema generated by the server.
- **Endpoint**: Usually mounted at `/_swagger`.
- **Live Testing**: Allows developers to test endpoints directly from the browser.

## GenroApiApp (API Explorer)
A specialized explorer for Genro-ASGI endpoints, providing a deeper look into the routing structure and available capabilities.
- **Inspection**: View all registered routes, their required `auth_tags`, and metadata.
- **Component View**: Understand how applications and routers are nested.
